# Predicting Funding Flows in Public and Private Markets

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the culmination of months of intensive research, analysis, and collaboration by a team of four students pursuing their Master of Science in Data Science at Michigan State University under the expert guidance of Professor Mohammad Ghassemi.

## Project Description
The world of finance is characterized by ever-shifting dynamics, where investors and decision-makers strive to anticipate market trends and make informed decisions. Predicting funding flows is a critical aspect of this process, as it can offer invaluable insights into market sentiment, economic conditions, and investment opportunities.

Our project aims to provide a robust framework for forecasting funding flows in public and private markets by harnessing the power of data science, time series analysis, and NLP. We understand that predicting funding flows is a challenging task due to the multifaceted nature of market data and the influence of external factors. However, we believe that a combination of advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques can help us make significant strides in this domain.
