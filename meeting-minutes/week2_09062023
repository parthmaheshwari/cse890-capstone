Meeting Minutes:

GitHub Repository Organization: It was decided that a folder would be created in the GitHub repository to store the minutes of meetings. The filename of each meeting's minutes will contain the meeting date. 

Dataset Updates: During the meeting, team members shared their progress on finding suitable datasets for the project. Parth and Vishal provided updates on financial datasets, while Nithya and Kuldeep discussed academic datasets. The pros and cons of these datasets were discussed.

Dataset Information Table: Professor Ghassemi suggested creating a table to store dataset information for easy lookup and comparison. The table should include dataset name, size, URL, dynamic/static nature, attributes, access details, data/file type, and any restrictions. The team was advised to highlight the dataset chosen for the project in this table and provide reasons for the selection. 

Webapp Development: Professor Ghassemi emphasized on writing code for the web app, assuming complete data. Any constraints on data or resources can be addressed later in the project timeline.

Distribution of Responsibilities: The concept of a "T-shaped" distribution of responsibilities was discussed. Professor Ghassemi encouraged team members to specialize in specific aspects of the project in addition to common tasks. The team was asked if they had decided on their specializations yet. 

Early Webapp Implementation: Professor Ghassemi recommended starting the implementation of the webapp as soon as possible, rather than waiting until the end of the semester. This would allow for regular review and necessary adjustments in weekly meetings.

Streamlit vs. Autogenerated Websites/Templates: There was a discussion about the team's skills in frontend development. Professor Ghassemi highlighted the importance of a well-designed webapp with a good user interface for a publicly released project. Nithya was tasked with researching a website generator tool called "Appsmith" and other options. 

VC Funding Dataset for Crunchbase: Parth volunteered to populate the fields of the application form for the Crunchbase VC funding dataset. 

Scheduling future meetings: Professor Ghassemi mentioned that the team can schedule meetings with him by booking slots on his calendar whenever they need to discuss something or require assistance.
