Meeting Minutes:

1. Data Warehouse Options

Parth shared his exploration of data warehouse options.
The team is finalizing Azure's Cosmos DB.
Professor Ghassemi approved this choice.

2. Financial VC Datasets Insights

Parth and Vishal presented insights from financial VC datasets.
Important columns for industry classification structure were identified.
NAICS categories were discussed.

3. Mapping of Categories

Discussion on mapping categories between public and private financial datasets.
Professor inquired about the level of taxonomization for both.
The goal is to establish common groupings for public and private companies.

4. Public Dataset Attributes

Nithya and Vishal shared important attributes and schema from the public dataset.
The "FieldOfStudy" attribute was considered too broad.
Professor suggested exploring keywords associated with research papers.
Emphasis on finding a common class structure for financial and academic datasets.

5. Mappings Discussion
Mappings discussed included Mesh, NAICS, TopicModels, and DBPedia.
Parth suggested having common topic models for both datasets.
Professor emphasized the need for thorough testing and sanity checks.

6. Ontology Research

Kuldeep provided updates on ontology research.
Introduced CSO for Computer Science ontology, a subset of DBpedia.
Discussed mapping strategies using Regex, Spacy, Fuzzy match, and Levenshtein distances.
Professor suggested mapping all datasets to DBpedia entities for the highest resolution.

7. Common Encoding
Professor reiterated the importance of a common encoding.
Suggested exploring off-the-shelf models.
Considered improving keyword selection for company abstracts.
In the absence of off-the-shelf solutions, team should brainstorm potential workarounds in the next meeting.

8. Embedding Space Browsing

Kuldeep will investigate embedding space browsing for DBpedia concepts.
Proposed calculating distances between noun phrases and DBpedia concepts.
Suggested optimization using Approximate Nearest Neighbors and FAISS by Meta.
The professor recommended using vector databases like ChromaDB for efficient execution.

Next Steps:

Finalize Azure Cosmos DB for data warehousing.
Continue refining industry classification structure with NAICS categories or use company abstracts
Work on common groupings for public and private financial datasets.
Explore keywords associated with research papers.
Focus on mapping all datasets to DBpedia entities.
Research off-the-shelf encoding models.
Investigate embedding space browsing with efficient algorithms.
Prepare potential workarounds for common encoding.
