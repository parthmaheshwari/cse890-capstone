The multiple Bluetooth functions are configured in the virtual devices and the main apparatus is connected with the multiple virtual devices, so connection interaction and communication traffic between the main apparatus and a slave apparatus can be reduced.

       "  'abstract': 'UTMS (universal traffic management systems), one of intelligent transportation systems (ITS)-related projects for effective traffic management in Japan, consists of integrated traffic control systems (ITCS) and five other subsystems. ITCS aims at obtaining more optimal traffic flow, using an infrared vehicle detector, which is a key infrastructure for UTMS, and plans to arrange widely over major road networks in the near future. Public transportation priority systems (PTPS), one of the six UTMS subsystems, have been designed to make the public transportation system more attractive for people by using both the new and existing information infrastructures. Regarding advanced mobile information systems (AMIS), it has a target of transmitting traffic information more broadly, rapidly, and accurately to motorists. Other than three outlined above, UTMS includes such subsystems as dynamic route guidance systems (DRGS), mobile operation control systems (MOCS), and environment protection management systems (EPMS). In this paper, the author describes an overall configuration of each subsystem, and procedures for introducing these subsystems into existing police traffic control centers, which currently prevail to every prefecture and large city nationwide.

       "  'abstract': 'Research on music generation using deep learning has at-tracted more attention; in particular, Transformer-based models have succeeded in generating coherent musical pieces. Recently, an increasing number of studies have focused on phrases that are smaller musical units, and several studies have addressed phrase-level control. In this study, we propose a method for sequentially generating a piece that enables the control of each phrase length and, conse-quently, the length of the entire piece. We added P HRASE and a new event, B AR C OUNTDOWN , which indicates the number of bars remaining in the phrase, to the existing event-based music representations. To reﬂect user input indicating the phrase lengths of the piece being generated, we used an autoregressive generation model that adds these two events to the generated event-token sequence based on the user input and uses it as input for the next time step. Subjective listening tests revealed that the pieces generated by our methods possessed designated phrase lengths and ended naturally at the determined length. 1',\n",

Firstly, we introduce coupled map lattice (CML) that is used a logistic map, to the moving equation of PSO. We consider that the PSO obtains two parts which are moving according to random vector and moving according similar vector by the CML phenomena. Secondly, we introduce Worker ant’s law to the moving equation of PSO. The Worker ant’s law is a variant of the Pareto’s law. The ratio of ants is 2:6:2 that include hard working ants, normal ants, and not working ants, respectively. We give the different momentum term for each swarm that is divided according to Worker ant’s law. It is considered that the search range can be expanded by the different momentum term without the divergence of solution search. We confirm that the CML and Worker ant’s law improve the solution searching ability of PSO by comparison with the general PSOs.',\n",

The method comprises the following steps: setting a plurality of virtual devices, wherein the virtual devices has independent device information and corresponds to at least one Bluetooth function; during device searching, switching the device information through time sharing to provide the information to a main apparatus; establishing connections between the virtual devices and the main apparatus; and carrying out the Bluetooth functions corresponding to the virtual devices. The multiple Bluetooth functions are configured in the virtual devices and the main apparatus is connected with the multiple virtual devices, so connection interaction and communication traffic between the main apparatus and a slave apparatus can be reduced. Moreover, great device connection stability and compatibility can be exhibited in a condition that multiple Profiles are integrated.',\n",

To efficiently operate the system, Particle Swarm optimization Algorithm (PSO) has been applied to the training of artificial neural networks and for finite element updating. The Neural Network controller is trained by using Back propagation Algorithms and data‟s collected from PSO. In this simulation work compared performance of Neural Network controlled switches capacitor with PSO and without PSO Algorithm of undergone. The results are analyzed and found that Non Linear Load condition the power factor of an Inductive circuit has improved in very short duration by using PSO Algorithm.. The proposed system can be used in application such as for improving performances of an induction machine. The proposed circuit has been simulated using MATLAB-SIMULINK environment.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'UTMS (universal traffic management systems), one of intelligent transportation systems (ITS)-related projects for effective traffic management in Japan, consists of integrated traffic control systems (ITCS) and five other subsystems. ITCS aims at obtaining more optimal traffic flow, using an infrared vehicle detector, which is a key infrastructure for UTMS, and plans to arrange widely over major road networks in the near future. Public transportation priority systems (PTPS), one of the six UTMS subsystems, have been designed to make the public transportation system more attractive for people by using both the new and existing information infrastructures. Regarding advanced mobile information systems (AMIS), it has a target of transmitting traffic information more broadly, rapidly, and accurately to motorists. Other than three outlined above, UTMS includes such subsystems as dynamic route guidance systems (DRGS), mobile operation control systems (MOCS), and environment protection management systems (EPMS). In this paper, the author describes an overall configuration of each subsystem, and procedures for introducing these subsystems into existing police traffic control centers, which currently prevail to every prefecture and large city nationwide. The results of experimental programs are also provided.',\n",
